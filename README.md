# purple-day-planner

# This is a daily planner to create a schedule

# When the  planner is opened then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

# When you scroll down then you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

# When you view the timeblocks for that day then each timeblock should be color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

# When you click into a timeblock then can enter an event

# When you click the save button for that timeblock then the text for that event should be saved in local storage

# When you refresh the page then the saved events should persist
